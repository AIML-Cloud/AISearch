#we can search content for its meaning in addition to keywords, and increase the chances the #user will find the information. The involvement of semantic search are profound â€” for example, #such a procedure would allow developers to search for any type of information code, syntax and #instumental data in repositories even if they are not familiar with the syntax or fail to #anticipate the right keywords or sequence. More importantly, you can generalize this approach #to objects such as pictures, audio and other things.
