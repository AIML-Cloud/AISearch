# AISearch
## AI Based Contextual Search Engine to find relevant document shared in a common vector space

we can search content for its meaning in addition to keywords, and increase the chances the user will find the information. The involvement of semantic search are profound â€” for example, such a procedure would allow developers to search for any type of information code, syntax and instumental data in repositories even if they are not familiar with the syntax or fail to anticipate the right keywords or sequence. More importantly, you can generalize this approach to objects such as pictures, audio and other things.

The goal is to map trained dataset into the vector space of natural language queries, such that (text, query) pairs that describe the same concept are close neighbors, whereas unrelated (text, query) pairs are further apart, measured by cosine similarity.
